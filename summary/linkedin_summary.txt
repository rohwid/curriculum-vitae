A lifelong learner who has big passion in information technologies. I have very good technical skills and an academic background in engineering (software and computer network), statistics, and machine learning. I also have an experience as Lead Network Engineer at startup company previously. 

In my bachelor degree studies, I focused on computer network research, setup the servers, databases, grid and cloud computing. Beside that, Iâ€™ve taken on various leadership roles in laboratory, social activities and competitions. 

In my master studies, I focused on AI research. I have learned some machine learning algorithms to solve some problems, deep learning, and present the output data. Beside the research activities in formal education, I usually adds more skills and resharps it such as programming with object-oriented, and design patterns. 

I am currently learning web development with React as frontend, Python as backend, deploy with CI tools and docker, and scale it with kubernetes. In spare time, usually in the early mornig, I learn more about the math which related to the machine learning and english grammar. In the near future, I would like to learn about competitive programming to make my algorithms works efectivelly. 

With a can do attitude, I ready to accepts new challenge, try to adapt quickly, and strive to give real impact to the organization.
