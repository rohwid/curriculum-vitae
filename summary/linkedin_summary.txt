A lifelong learner who has big passion in information technologies. I have very good technical skills and an academic background in engineering (software and computer network), statistics, and machine learning. I also have an experience as Lead Network Engineer at startup company previously. In my bachelor degree studies, I focused on computer network research, setup the servers, databases, grid and cloud computing. Beside that, I’ve taken on various leadership roles in laboratory, social activities and competitions. In my master studies, I focused on AI research. I have learned some machine learning algorithms to solve some problems, deep learning, and present the output data. Beside the research activities in formal education, I usually adds more skills and resharps it such as programming with object-oriented, and design patterns. I am currently learning web development with React as frontend, Python as backend, deploy with CI tools and docker, and scale it with kubernetes. In spare time, usually in the early mornig, I learn more about the math which related to the machine learning and english grammar. In the near future, I would like to learn about competitive programming to make my algorithms works efectivelly. With a can do attitude, I ready to accepts new challenge, try to adapt quickly, and strive to give real impact to the organization.
